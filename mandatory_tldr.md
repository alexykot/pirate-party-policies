# Mandatory TL;DR

Make TL;DR section a mandatory part of every legally binding document.
The TL;DR section has to be:


- prominent part, no fine print
- written in simple english
- clearly stating what the document is about
- clearly setting out important details, costs, liabilities, term dates etc
- be legally binding by itself, and prevail the full version, i.e.
if anything in TL;DR is contradicting the main body - the TL;DR prevails.
- for every statement have references to relevangt parts of the
main document body
